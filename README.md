# Hotel_Reservation_App


In this project, you will be designing and implementing a Java hotel reservation application. The hotel reservation application will allow customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. This project will demonstrate your abilities to design classes using OOP, organize and process data with collections, and use common Java types.

The main components for the  Hotel Reservation Application will consist of the following:

1. CLI for the User Interface. We'll use the Command Line Interface (or CLI for the user interface. For this, we'll need to have Java monitor the CLI for user input, so the user can enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and so on.
2. The second main component is the Java code itselfâ€”this is where we add our business logic for the app.
3. Finally, we'll use Java collections for in-memory storage of the data we need for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.
